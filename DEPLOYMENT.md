# üöÄ Deployment Guide for Vercel

## Quick Deploy Steps

### Step 1: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
cd "/Users/shl/Desktop/simple calc"
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration for static deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your repository: `Shobhithahl/simple-calculator`
5. **Important**: Configure as follows:
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty or use `echo "Static site"`
   - **Output Directory**: Leave as `.` (root)
6. Click "Deploy"

## What We've Configured

### Files Added for Vercel:

1. **`vercel.json`** - Tells Vercel this is a static site
2. **`index.html`** - Entry point that redirects to the game
3. **`package.json`** - Defines the project (prevents React detection)
4. **`.vercelignore`** - Excludes Python files from deployment

### How It Works:

- Vercel serves your HTML files as static content
- When someone visits your site, they see `index.html`
- `index.html` automatically redirects to `sudoku_standalone.html`
- The game runs entirely in the browser (no server needed!)

## Your Deployed URL

After deployment, Vercel will give you a URL like:
```
https://simple-calculator-xyz.vercel.app
```

You can also set up a custom domain if you want!

## Testing Before Deploy

You can test locally:
```bash
# Install vercel CLI (optional)
npm i -g vercel

# Test deployment
vercel dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Command 'react-scripts build' exited with 127"
**Solution**: This is fixed! The `vercel.json` and `package.json` files tell Vercel it's a static site, not React.

### Error: "No output directory"
**Solution**: The output directory should be `.` (root) since `index.html` and `sudoku_standalone.html` are in the root.

### Build succeeds but page is blank
**Solution**: Make sure `index.html` and `sudoku_standalone.html` are both committed to GitHub.

## Alternative: Manual Deployment

If automatic deployment doesn't work, you can deploy manually:

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy from your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/shl/Desktop/simple calc"
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. Follow the prompts
